# Loan_approval_prediction
Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning's Probability Classifier.

To Run Applications = python app.py


Overview:
The Loan Approval Prediction App is a web-based app that predicts loan approval likelihood using machine learning algorithms. It uses Flask web framework and scikit-learn for the classification model.

Features:
1.User-friendly web interface for loan application
2.Classification model using Logistic Regression algorithm
3.Flask integration for back-end development and deployment
4.Input validation for ensuring accurate user inputs
5.Real-time feedback on loan approval likelihood

Functionality:
Users fill out a loan application form on the web interface, providing information such as age, income, credit score, and loan amount. The app uses a trained Logistic Regression model to predict the likelihood of loan approval. The prediction is displayed on the web interface in real-time, assisting users in making informed financial decisions.

Deployment:
The app was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end interface and Python and scikit-learn for the back-end development. Flask web framework allows the app to run on a local or cloud-based server.

Conclusion:
The Loan Approval Prediction App provides an accurate and real-time prediction of loan approval, benefiting both financial institutions and individuals seeking loans. The app is efficient and easy to deploy, making it a valuable tool for predicting loan approvals.
